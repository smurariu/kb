# The Scrum Guide
### Lecture notes

Scrum is a **framework** for developing _complex, adaptive products_. Scrumâ€™s 
definition consists of:

* Roles
* Events
* Artifacts
* Rules

Scrum IS
- A framework within which people can address complex, adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value
- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

Scrum IS NOT
- A process or technique
- A recipe for solving a particular problem

Scrum is founded on Empirical Process Control Theory. The 3 guiding priniples of this theory are:

## Transparency
Significant aspects of the process must be visible (and shared between) to those responsible for the outcome.
Like the defintion of "Done" or an ubiqutous language for referring to the Scrum process.

## Inspection
Scrum users must frequently inspect the Scrum Artifacts and progress towards a Sprint Goal

## Adaptation
If it is determined that aspects of a process deviate resulting in an unacceptable product, an adjustment must be done as soon as possible to minimize further deviation. 


Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaption:
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Values
- Commitment
- Courage
- Respect
- Openness
- Focus

**Commitmnet** is personal. 

**Courage** to do the right thing and work on tough problems.

**Focus** is on the work of the sprint and goal of the team.

**Openness** between the scrum team and the stakeholders (regarding the work and the challenges in carrying it out).

**Respect** between the team members to be capable, independent people.

## The Scrum Team

- 1 x Product Owner
- 1 x Development Team
- 1 x Scrum Master

Are self-organizing and cross-functional.

Self-organizing means nobody tells them (the Product Owner, Development Team and Scrum Master) how to do their job.

Cross-functional means that they have all the competencies necessary to do the work and they **do not** depend on external parties.

The team delivers products **iteratively** and **incrementally**. Each delivery can potentially be released to users.

## The Product Owner
Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Scrum Team.

The Product Owner is the sole responsible for managing the Product Backlog and this includes:

- Clearly expressing the Backlog Items
- Ordering items to best achieve goals and missions
- Optimize the VALUE of the work that the Development Team performs
- Ensuring that the Backlog is visible, transparent and shows what the team will work on next
- Ensuring that the Development Team understands the items on the Backlog to the level needed for them to perform the work

The Product Owner may represent others but is **one person**. For a Product Owner to succeed the entire organization must respect her decissions. 

## The Development Team
A team whos members create the Increment of "Done". The Development Teams are structured by the organization and empowered to organize and manage their own work thus optimizing their efficiency and effectiveness.

Characteristics
- Self-organizing (nobody tells them how to turn the Backlog into "increments of done")
- Cross-functional (independent)
- Members of the team have no other titles than developer. (A team of peers)
- No sub-teams within the dev-team
- Members may have specialized skills but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole

Size (matters)
- Small enough to remain agile
- No less than three
- No more than nine
- Product Owner excluded. Scrum Master excluded unless a developer.

## The Scrum Master
- Responsible for ensuring Scrum is **understood** and **enacted**. (ensures that the events take place and that the attendants understand its purpose)
- Is a Servant-leader.
- Helps others outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the team are usefull and which aren't and helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value delivered by the Scrum Team.

### Service to the Product Owner
- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise PBIs
- Understanding product planning in an empirical (agile) environmnent
- Ensuring The Product Owner knows how to arrange PBIs to maximize value
- Helps The Product Owner understand and practice Agility
- Facilitates Scrum events as needed

### Service to the Development Team
- Coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality
- Helping to create high-value products
- Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress
- Facilitating Scrum events as needed
- Coaching the team in organziational environmnents where scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood

### Service to the Organization
- Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
- Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand  and enact Scrum
- Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
- Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of scrum in the organization

# Scrum Events
The scrum events are meant to create regularity and minimize the need for meetings not defined in scrum.
Although time-boxed an event may end whenever its purpose was achieved. 
Each event is an opportunity to inspect and adapt something and are designed to enable critical transparency and inspection.

Failure to include any of these events (or to execute them properly) results in reduced transparency and a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt (to improve).

## The Sprint
Time-boxed to one month or less, during which a "Done", usable and potentially releasable Product Increment is created by the Development Team. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previons sprint. 

Sprints consist of:
- The Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrums
- Development work
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

During the sprint:
- No changes are made that would endanger the sprint goal
- Quality goals do not decrease
- Scope may be clarified and re-negociated with the Product Owner if new info is learned

Think of each sprint as a project used to acomplish something.

Sprints are short in order to:
- Limit the costs (and therefore the risk)
- Enable predictability through frequent inspections
- Ensure the definition of what is being built does not change

### Cancelling a Sprint

- Only The Product Owner can do it
- It happens if the goal becomes obsolete (short sprint durations generally prevent this)
- All incomplete PBIs are re-estimated and put back on the Backlog

## Sprint Planning (2h/Sprint Week)

Two things are discussed: the WHAT and the HOW.

### What can be done this Sprint
- Product Owner discusses the objective that the sprint should achieve
- Product Owner discusses the PBIs that, if completed, would achieve the OBJECTIVE

Taking into account: the Product Backlog, the latest Product Increment the projected Capacity and past performance of the Development Team, the Development Team decides **the number** of items that are selected from the Product Backlog to be transfered to the Sprint Backlog. 

After selecting how many PBIs will be delivered the whole team decides on the Sprint Goal (the objective of the sprint).

### How to do it
Having selected the PBIs that will be implemented during the sprint the Development Team decides how to do it.
The PBIs + A PLAN on how to deliver them is called a Sprint Backlog.

The Development Team starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the backlog into a working product increment.
Work scheduled to be executed during the first days of a siprint is decomposed into units (tasks) of a day or less.

The Product Owner may help clarify PBIs. The Development Team may renegociate PBIs with The Product Owner. The Development Team may invite other people in order to provide technical or domain experitze.

By the end of the Sprint Planning the Development Team should be able to explain to Product Owner and Scrum Master how it plans to deliver the product increment.

## The Sprint Goal
Is an objective set for the Sprint that is met through implementing the Sprint Backlog. 

## The Daily Scrum (15m/Sprint-Day)
- Is for the Development Team to synchronize activities and plan the next 24h
- Held at the SAME TIME and SAME PLACE each day to reduce complexity

### Each member explains: 
- What he has done yesterday THAT HELPED the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal
- What he will do TODAY to HELP the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal
- Mention any impediments he thinks would prevent him or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal

The Development Team inspects progress toward the Sprint Goal. Often members meet immediately after this meeting for detailed discussions or to adapt/replan the rest of the Sprint's work.
It is a key inspect and adapt meeting.

The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only members of the Development Team attend.

## Sprint Review (1h/Sprint-Week)

Held at the end of each sprint to inspect the Increment. During this meeting feedback is gathered and the Product Backlog is adapted if needed.   
Stakeholders and Scrum Team collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. 

The Sprint Review includes: 
- Scrum Team + key stakeholders invited by The Product Owner
- The Product Owner explains what items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done"
- The Development Team explains what went well, problems it ran into and how they were solved
- The Development Team demonstrates the product increment, and answers questions about it
- The Product Owner discusses the Backlog as it stands, projecting likely completion dates
- The group collaborates on what to do next so the Sprint Review provides valuable input for the upcoming Sprint Planning
- The group decides on what the most valuable thing to do next is based on the way that the marketplace or potential use of the product have changed
- Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities and marketplace for the next release of the product.

The result is a revised product backlog.

## Sprint Retrospective (45min/Sprint-Week)

An opportunity for the team to inspect itself and improve.
Occurs after the Sprint Review and before the Sprint Planning.
The team creates a plan for improvements to be ENACTED in the next Sprint.
The Srum Master participates as a peer in the meeting, being accountable for the Scrum Process.

The purpose of the Retrospective is to:
- Inspect how the last sprint went with regards to People, Relationships, Processes and Tools
- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements
- Create a plan for implementing the improvements in the next sprint

The purpose of the meeting is to make the next sprint more EFFECTIVE and ENJOYABLE while also increasing the product QUALITY and revising the definition of done.
Improvements can be implemented at any time but this event provides a formal opportunity to focus on INSPECTION and ADAPTION.

# The Scrum Artifacts

The artifacts are either work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. The artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding of the artifact.

## Product Backlog

Ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product. Single source of requirements for any changes. The Product Owner is responsible for the content, avaiability and ordering of the Product Backlog. 

The product backlog is forever changing based on what the product needs to be competitive on the market, fulfill the needs of its users, etc. 

The PBIs have 3 properties: Description, Estimate and Value. A fourth property could be the order in the Backlog.

If **multiple teams** work on the same product they share the **same Product Backlog**. In this case an additional attribute of each PBI can be added to designate the team working on it. 


### Product Backlog Refinement
- is the act of adding **detail**, **estimates** and **order** to the PBIs. 
- is an ongoing process in which The Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of the PBIs
- the Scrum Team decides how and when it is done
- must consume no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team
- however, the PBIs can be updated at any time by The Product Owner

Higher order PBIs are usually clearer and more deatailed and have more precise estimates that are the result of this clarity.

PBIs that can be included in the next sprint are refined so that any one item can reasonably be "Done" within the sprint time-box.

The people who will perform the work (Development Team) make the estimate. 

## Monitoring Progress Towards a Goal
At any point the work remaning to reach a goal can be summed. 
The Product Owner tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review. 
The Product Owner compares the remaing work with the remaining work at the end of the previous sprints to asses progress towards a goal.
This infomation is made transparent to all stakeholders.

## Sprint Backlog
Is a subset of PBIs selected by the development team to be delivered during the 
Sprint in a "Done" increment of the product along with a plan of how to deliver it.

It makes visible all the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the sprint goal.

It is a plan with enough detail so that changes in progress can be understood during the Daily Scrum.
It emerges during the Sprint as the Development Team learns more about the work needed to reach the Sprint Goal.
Only the Development Team can change the Sprint Backlog during the Sprint.

## Monitoring Sprint Progress
At any point in the Sprint, the work needed to reach the Sprint Goal can be summed up.
The Development Team tracks this total at every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. 
This enables the Development Team to track its progress.

## Increment
The Increment is the sum of all the PBIs completed during the Sprint that meet the definition of Done.
These increments must be in usable and releasable condition regardless if The Product Owner decides to release it or not.

# Artifact Transparency
Decisions to optimize value and control risk are based on the percieved state of affairs. 
If transparency is complete these decisions have a sound basis. 

The Scrum Master must work with The Product Owner, Development Team and everybody involved to understand if the artifacts are completely transparent. 
The Scurm Master must work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase transparency.

# Definition of "Done"
When a PBI is described as "Done", everyone must have a shared understanding of what "Done" actually means. 
This varies greatly from team to team. 

This definition determines how many PBIs can be selected during a Sprint Planning. 

If there are **multiple teams** working on the same product, a **shared defintion of "Done"** is mandatory.

Each increment is thoroughly tested, ensuring that all increments work together. 
As Scrum Teams mature it is expected that the definitoin of "Done" is more stringent for higher quality. 

# Ending
Although implementing only part of the Scurm's artifacts, roles, events and rules
is possible the result is not Scrum.
